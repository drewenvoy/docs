# Create a Workflow

This guide walks you through creating a workflow in Envoy.

Once created, the Envoy team will test and validate the workflow. Upon successful validation, Envoy will automatically run the workflow on all loads that meet the trigger criteria.

---

## Prerequisites

- You have downloaded the Envoy app to Teams and logged in successfully.
- All necessary integrations (TMS, compliance, other) are complete.

## Steps

1. **Log In**
   - Sign in to your Envoy instance.
2. **Go to Workflows**
   - From the sidebar, click **Workflows** to open the workflow tab.
3. **Create the workflow**
   - Click the **Create Worklow** button.
4. **Add workflow name and description**
   - Under **Workflow Properties**, add a name and description for your workflow. The name should be unique to this workflow.
5. **Add your first two nodes**
   - Click the **Add Node** button and select
   - Youâ€™ll see a list of different nodes to add.
   - Select a node from the list and then click on the canvas to add the node.
   - Node ID is autogenerated. You can update `Display Name`, `Description` , and a variety of other fields depending on the type of node.
   - Repeat for second node
6. **Add your first edge**
   - Connect the bottom of your first node with the top of your second node.
   - Once created, you can add a `Condition Expression` to make the edge conditional.
7. \*\*Select an \*\*`Entry Node`
   - Choose the first node to be your entry node.
   - This determines the beginning of the workflow and what causes the workflow to run.
8. **Fix any validation errors**
9. **Save your workflow**
   - Click **Save Workflow** button on bottom right of screen.
